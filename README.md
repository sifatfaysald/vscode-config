# My VSCode Config

This VSCode config is all about keeping your coding space simple and easy to use — especially if you’re into JavaScript and web dev. It helps make your code neat and readable, with just the right features turned on so nothing gets in your way. Plus, it’s lightweight and fast, so your editor feels smooth all day long.


## What’s inside?

- **Fonts & Typography:**
  Picked fonts that are easy on the eyes, with ligatures turned on to make your code look neat and stylish.

- **Cursor Experience:**
  A simple, smooth cursor that gently blinks and moves, so you can always keep track without distractions.

- **Editor Layout:**
  Clean and minimal — no minimap stealing space, but whitespace shows up where it helps. Lines wrap nicely so you don’t have to scroll sideways.

- **Tabs & Indentation:**
  Uses 2 spaces per tab (because JS loves that), with smart auto-indent that keeps your code tidy and consistent.

- **Formatting & Suggestions:**
  Your code gets automatically formatted on save and paste, plus inline suggestions pop up just when you need them — never in your way.

- **Brackets & Scrolling:**
  Colorful bracket pairs and helpful guides make it easy to spot matching brackets, plus smooth scrolling keeps navigation fluid.

- **File Handling:**
  Automatically cleans up extra spaces at the end of lines and makes sure every file ends with a newline — little things that add up.

- **Workbench & Terminal:**
  Sticks with the default dark theme, but colors for status bar and terminal are tweaked for comfort during long coding sessions.

- **Git & User Interface:**
  Git decorations are on so you can see changes at a glance. Breadcrumbs are off by default for a cleaner look, but you can switch them on anytime.


## How to get started

1. Just copy this config and drop it into your VSCode `settings.json`.
2. Swap out the fonts if you don’t have `"Operator Mono"`—any good monospace works fine.
3. Grab some of the recommended extensions to level up your setup (check the list if you want).
4. That’s it! Now you’re all set for a smoother, cleaner coding experience. Enjoy!
